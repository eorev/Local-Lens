# Local Lens

## Inspiration

Driven by the noticeable gap in young voter engagement in recent years, we were inspired to create a change not just within our communities but also beyond. Our aim with Local Lens is to bridge this gap by providing up-to-date, unbiased information on local politicians, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence.

## What It Does

Local Lens serves as a dynamic platform offering users current, impartial information about politicians in their areaâ€”whether they are currently in office or running for office. By integrating artificial intelligence, we ensure that the information provided is comprehensive and accessible, empowering users to make informed decisions.

## How We Built It

Local Lens is built with a modern tech stack that includes:

- **Frontend:** React and Next.js for a robust, scalable, and efficient user interface.
- **Backend:** Firebase for managing user data and authentication services.
- **APIs:** We utilized a geocoding API for location-based services, a civics information API for retrieving political data, and the OpenAI API for generating insightful, unbiased content.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Throughout the development process, we encountered challenges such as initializing our authentication services and familiarizing ourselves with new APIs, particularly the OpenAI API. Despite these hurdles, our team's collective effort and determination led us to overcome them, culminating in a product we are truly proud of.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

One of our major achievements was successfully integrating artificial intelligence into Local Lens. This was the most significant challenge we faced, and mastering it has been immensely rewarding.

## What We Learned

The development journey of Local Lens has been a profound learning experience for our team. Key takeaways include mastering the OpenAI API, understanding how to engage younger demographics effectively, and applying UI/UX principles to create an engaging and intuitive web experience.
